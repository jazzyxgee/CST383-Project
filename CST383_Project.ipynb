        "### The source data is from: http://www.murderdata.org/p/data-docs.html. The objective is to figure out how the US government and police force are being accountable for homicides, both solved and unsolved homicides. We need to know which weapons are being used and characteristics of the offenders and victims. We hope that this data can be used to figure out what types of regulations can be propose to help solve these murders. We will be using VicAge, OffAge, and Relationship to predict Weapon. We will be predicting the murder weapon."
