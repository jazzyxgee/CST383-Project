# Murder Data Weapon Predictions

## Introduction
The source data is from: http://www.murderdata.org/p/data-docs.html. The objective is to figure out how the US government and police force are being accountable for homicides, both solved and unsolved homicides. We need to know which weapons are being used and characteristics of the offenders and victims. We hope that this data can be used to figure out what types of regulations can be propose to help solve these murders. We will be using VicAge, OffAge, and Relationship to predict Weapon. We will be predicting the murder weapon.

## Selection of Data

There are 23 features and 827219 entries. We removed some features that were empty and unnecessary like ID, Ori, Source, and etc. We created other dataframes that focus on California and New York so that we can compare the two states.
The data we will be working with has 6 numeric features and 17 categorical features.
We will be using VicAge, OffAge, and Relationship as predictors, and our target will be Weapon. We will be predicting the murder Weapon.

ID – Unique record identifier generated by MAP based upon the YEAR, MONTH, INCIDENT and ORI code in the report. Alphanumeric 16-character format (A16). CNTYFIPS – The Census Bureau’s Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code designating the state and county of the reporting law enforcement agency. is associated with a five-digit string variable. When using the Comma Separated Values format file (file extension=.csv) the original FIPS coding is replaced with the label indicating the county and state. (A15).

ORI – The alphanumeric variable describing the Originating Agency making the report. The first two digits describe the state of the Originating Agency, the next three digits usually represent the county in which the agency is located (according to an FBI numbering scheme) and the last two digits describe the agency’s number within the state. (A7)

STATE – The alphanumeric variable describing the state of the Originating Agency making the report. In most cases, the state was coded in a two-digit naming scheme. In the SPSS version of the file, the full name of the state is associated as a label so that “AK” = “Alaska” or “AL” = “Alabama.” (A6).

AGENCY – The alphanumeric variable describing the name of the law enforcement agency making the report. (A450).

AGENTYPE – The one-digit numeric code describing the type of law enforcement agency making the report so that 1=Sheriff, 2=County Police, 3=Municipality, 5=Primary State Law Enforcement usually meaning the State Police, 6=Special Police, 7=Constable, 8=Tribal Police, 9=Regional Police. When using the Comma Separated Values format file (file extension=.csv) the original FBI numbering scheme is replaced with the alphanumeric label. (F1.0). 1=Sheriff 2=County Police 3=Municipality 5=Primary State Law Enforcement usually meaning the State Police 6=Special Police 7=Constable 8=Tribal Police 9=Regional Police

SOURCE – MAP-generated identifier if record provided by FBI (SOURCE=1) or was obtained by MAP under the Freedom of Information Act from an Agency not participating in SHR reporting to the FBI (SOURCE=0). Numeric single digit format. (F1.0).

SOLVED – MAP-generated indicator whether Offender was identified at time report was made (SOLVED=1) or not identified (SOLVED=0). Numeric single digit format. (F1.0).

YEAR – Year of homicide (or when victim’s body was recovered.) Numeric four digit. (F4.0).

STATENAME = Alphanumeric variable describing the original FBI naming and abbreviating scheme for the state of the reporting agency. (A6).

MONTH – The month of homicide occurrence or when the victim’s body was recovered. So that 01=January and 02=February through 12=December. Numeric two digit. (F2.0).

INCIDENT – A three-digit number describing the case number within the month in which a homicide occurred. This does not necessarily correspond to the actual case number used inhouse by police agencies. It is used to assist in building a unique record number for each case and to differentiate each case reported within the same month. (F3.0).

ACTIONTYPE – A numeric variable describing the nature of the report received. Whether it was: 0=Normal Update or 1=Adjustment to a previous report. (F1.0).

HOMICIDE – An alphanumeric variable defining whether the report was “A” = “Murder or Nonnegligent manslaughter” or “B” = “Manslaughter by Negligence.” (A1).

SITUATION – An alphanumeric variable defining whether the crime had a single victim or multiple victims and whether there was a single offender, multiple offenders or the number of offenders was unknown. So that “A” = “Single Victim/Single Offender” and “B” = “Single Victim/Unknown Offender” and so forth. (A1).

VICAGE – A three-digit numeric variable describing the age in years of the victim. To allow for simpler mathematical calculations, MAP has changed the original alphanumeric coding of “NB” for new born and “BB” for infant to a numeric value of zero to indicate the victim had not achieved a full year of life. A value of 99, as in the original numbering scheme, represents all victims 99 or older. A value of 999 represents victims whose age was not reported, usually because the victim was unidentified and the age was unknown. (F3.0).

VICSEX – An alphanumeric variable representing whether the victim was “M” = ”Male” or “F” = ”Female” or “U” indicating “Unknown” gender, usually for conditions in which incomplete remains were recovered. (A1).

VICRACE – An alphanumeric variable representing whether the victim was “A” = “Asian or Pacific Islander” or “B” = “Black” or “I” = “American Indian or Alaskan Native” or “W” = “White” or “U” victim was of “Unknown” race. (A1).

VICETHNIC – An alphanumeric variable representing whether the victim was “H” = “Hispanic Origin” or “N” = “Not of Hispanic Origin” or “U” = “Unknown or Not Reported.” It should be noted that many agencies decline reporting the ethnicity of victims and offenders. (A1).

OFFAGE – A three-digit numeric variable describing the age in years of the offender. When the offender was not identified at the time of the report, age was reported as 999. A value of 99 represents all offenders 99 or older. (F3.0).

OFFSEX – An alphanumeric variable representing whether the offender was “M”=”Male” or “F”=”Female” or “U” indicating “Unknown” gender, usually in conditions in which the offender had not been identified at the time of the report. (A1).

OFFRACE – An alphanumeric variable representing whether the offender was “A” = “Asian or Pacific Islander” or “B” = “Black” or “I” = “American Indian or Alaskan Native” or “W” = “White” or “U” = “Unknown” race, usually in conditions in which the offender had not been identified at the time of the report. (A1).

OFFETHNIC – An alphanumeric variable representing whether the offender was “H” = “Hispanic Origin” or “N” = “Not of Hispanic Origin” or “U” = “Unknown or Not Reported.” It should be noted that many agencies decline reporting the ethnicity of victims and offenders. (A1).

WEAPON – A two-digit numeric variable representing the weapon used in the crime. (F2.0). Under this system, weapons are coded as: 11 = Firearm, type not stated 12 = Handgun – pistol, revolver, etc. 13 = Rifle 14 = Shotgun 15 = Other gun 20 = Knife or cutting instrument 30 = Blunt object – hammer, club, etc. 40 = Personal weapons, including beating 50 = Poison, does not include gas 55 = Pushed or thrown out of window 60 = Explosives 65 = Fire 70 = Narcotics or drugs, sleeping pills 75 = Drowning 80 = Strangulation or hanging 85 = Asphyxiation – includes death by gas 90 = Other or type unknown weapon

RELATIONSHIP – An alphanumeric variable describing the relationship between the victim and the offender, if any. (A2). Under the original FBI criteria, relationship is coded as: “AQ” = “Acquaintance” “BF” = “Boyfriend” “BR” = “Brother” “CH” = “Common-law husband” “CW” = “Common-law wife” “DA” = “Daughter” “EE” = “Employee” “ER” = “Employer” “FA” = “Father” “FR” = “Friend” “GF” = “Girlfriend” “HO” = “Homosexual relationship” “HU” = “Husband” “IL” = “In-law” “MO” = “Mother” “NE” = “Neighbor” “OF” = “Other family” “OK” = “Other - known to victim” “SD” = “Stepdaughter” “SF” = “Stepfather” “SI” = “Sister” “SM” = “Stepmother” “SO” = “Son” “SS” = “Stepson” “ST” = “Stranger” “UN” = “Relationship not determined” “WI” = “Wife” “XH” = “Ex-husband” “XW” = “Ex-wife”

CIRCUMSTANCES – A two-digit numeric variable representing the circumstances (or theory) for the crime. (F2.0). The circumstances under the original FBI coding scheme are represented as: 2 = Rape 3 = Robbery 5 = Burglary 6 = Larceny 7 = Motor vehicle theft 9 = Arson 10 = Prostitution and commercialized vice 17 = Other sex offense 18 = Narcotic drug laws 19 = Gambling 26 = Other - not specified 32 = Abortion 40 = Lovers triangle 41 = Child killed by babysitter 42 = Brawl due to influence of alcohol 43 = Brawl due to influence of narcotics 44 = Argument over money or property 45 = Other arguments 46 = Gangland killings 47 = Juvenile gang killings 48 = Institutional killings 49 = Sniper attack 50 = Victim shot in hunting accident 51 = Gun-cleaning death - other than self 52 = Children playing with gun 53 = Other negligent handling of gun 59 = All other manslaughter by negligence 60 = Other 70 = All suspected felony type 80 = Felon killed by private citizen 81 = Felon killed by police 99 = Circumstances undetermined

SUBCIRCUM – A single-digit alphanumeric variable describing several conditions in which the victim is reported to have been a criminal offender. (A2). Under the original FBI coding, these conditions are described as: “A” = “Felon attacked police officer” “B” = “Felon attacked fellow police officer” “C” = “Felon attacked a civilian” “D” = “Felon attempted flight from a crime” “E” = “Felon killed in commission of a crime” “F” = “Felon resisted arrest”

VICCOUNT – The number of additional victims (not counting the victim included in the current record) included in the Supplementary Homicide Report’s incident record, which can accept up to 10 additional victims in a single incident report. (F3.0) Incidents of mass murder of more than 11 victims would require multiple SHR incident reports. The Murder Accountability Project’s database captures all reported homicide victims as separate cases. Associated victims will have identical ID numbers.

OFFCOUNT – The number of additional offenders (not counting the offender included in the current record) included in the Supplementary Homicide Report’s incident record, which can accept up to 10 additional offenders in a single incident report. (F3.0) Unlike victims, the Murder Accountability Project does not create multiple case reports for additional offenders. Only the first offender listed in the original SHR report is included.

FILEDATE – A six-digit alphanumeric variable describing the date a record was reported, not the date of the occurrence of the crime. Note, in some cases, date was not reported and has been estimated. In some cases, the date indicates when local or state police provided the record to MAP. A value of “030180” means the record was reported on March 1, 1980. (A6).

FSTATE – A two-digit alphanumeric variable representing the state in which a homicide was reported. A value of “01” = “Alabama” and “02” = “Alaska” and so forth. (A2)

MSA – An eight-digit numeric variable representing the Census Bureau’s Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code for the Metropolitan Statistical Area from which a record was reported. When using the Comma Separated Values format file (file extension=.csv) the original FIPS coding is replaced with the label indicating the metropolitan area. (F8.0).

## Discussion
After exploring the data and visualizing it, it was revealed that there were many unknown pieces of information. Our original hypothesis was to find out whether we can predict Weapon based on VicAge, OffAge, and Relationship. Relationship and Weapon are categorical, and in turn, were difficult to convert to numerical data. 
We modified our hypothesis to identify the age of the victim from the age of the offender. We performed LinearRegression, found the intercepts, and checked the accuracy of our models.
The model's accuracy scores suggest that our models are insufficient for the prediction, even after modifications. 

## Summary
In summary, we set off to find out whether this information could help investigators solve more murders based off our predictions. While the dataset is useful, it was packed with data that was not easy to work with. Due to the amount of data, it affected our initial goal. Applying what we learned in class, we modified our hypothesis and worked with OffAge to predict VicAge.
